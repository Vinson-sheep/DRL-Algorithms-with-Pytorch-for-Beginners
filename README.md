**Status:** Active (under active development, breaking changes may occur)

**origin project:** [Deep-reinforcement-learning-with-pytorch](https://github.com/sweetice/Deep-reinforcement-learning-with-pytorch)

Since the origin project is lack of maintenance by the author for years, this project is a long term active version with bug-fixing.
